Missing And Repeating
Given an unsorted array arr[] of size n, containing elements from the range 1 to n, it is known that one number in this range is missing, and another number occurs twice in the array, find both the duplicate number and the missing number.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, 2]
Output: [2, 1]
Explanation: Repeating number is 2 and the missing number is 1.

Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 3] 
Output: [3, 2]
Explanation: Repeating number is 3 and the missing number is 2.

Solution:
class Solution {
    ArrayList<Integer> findTwoElement(int arr[]) {
        // code here
        int n=arr.length;
        boolean[] seen =new boolean[n+1];
        int repeat=-1,missing=-1;
        for(int num:arr){
            if(seen[num]) repeat=num;
            else seen[num]=true;
        }
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
            if(!seen[i]){
                missing=i;
                break;
            }
        }
        return new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(repeat, missing));
    }
}
